# Ontario Tourism Project(Hackathon)

## Welcome to Ontario, Canada
This is a website that introduced our beautiful Province, Ontario. Ontario is a term thought to be derived from Ontar√≠:io, a Huron (Wyandot) word meaning "great lake" because it has about 250,000 freshwater lakes. The website described the beautiful sight seen in our province, especically in summer, and this website also contains a video that introduce our province. Everyone can enjoy the fresh air and happiness when traveling in any city of Ontario. The color will be orange with blue mixed to represent the passainate of Ontario. We hope you can find everything you want and felt relax. We wish you a pleasent journey! Again, Welcome to Ontario, Canada!
